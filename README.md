# 🛰️ Bachelor Thesis 
## 📌 About the Project  
This repository contains code, data, and documentation for our **bachelor thesis** at the **Technical University of Denmark (DTU)** in collaboration with the **Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)**. The project explores the use of **simulated CIMR (Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer) and MWI (Microwave Imager) data** for **sea ice applications**.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
🔹 **Process & analyze** simulated CIMR and MWI data.  
🔹 **Investigate** their potential for **sea ice concentration and temperature retrieval**.  
🔹 **Compare** results with existing satellite data and models.  
🔹 **Explore** applications in **climate physics & remote sensing**.  

## 📂 Data
